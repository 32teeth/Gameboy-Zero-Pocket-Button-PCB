# Informations
This button PCB is for the Gameboy Pocket to make a Gameboy Zero or an Arduboy.

I haven't tested this PCB, but it works in theory.
## Pictures of the PCB
You find pictures in the PCB pictures folder. Also, a pinout for the header is there. I'll add text on the PCB in the next revisions.
